# 2D-materials

This project is supervised by Professor Pan Jinbo from Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Science.

I learned in this project:
* Density Functional Theory (DFT) for computational quantum mechanical modelling
* VASP software for DFT simulation

Based on DFT simulation results, we plan to employ machine learning algorithms to make predictions about 2-dimensional materials.
